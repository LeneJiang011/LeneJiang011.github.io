<p><strong>Claim</strong><br>We propose that by feeding back the swing and a miss, players can learn from their misses. In that way, we suppose that 1) players can use that information to adjust their impact points, 2) players’ performance can be evaluated more objectively, and 3) the learning process can be more encouraging because every effort is meaningful.</p>
<p><strong>Status: Under Survey</strong><br>Different from <a href="http://lenejiang.com/2021/02/04/MTL/">MTL</a> that focuses on the flow state, this project focuses more on how to trigger errorless learning.<br>While I know little about errorless learning, the status of this project is still under survey.<br>In the following I will roughly explore study plans.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br>Racket sports require players to hit a moving ball with a moving racket. While playing racket sports, players can miss to hit the ball when they swing the racket too fast or inaccurately. However, since both the ball and the racket are dynamically moving, players can hardly reflect how they miss the ball. Moreover, players can hardly get feedback from a missed ball, which results in few chances for players to learn from their misses.<br>Therefore, we propose to feeding back the swing and a miss, creating chances for players to learn from their misses. </p>
<p><strong>VIRTUAL IMPLEMENTATION</strong><br>The idea of the project comes from my previous <a href="http://lenejiang.com/2021/02/04/MTL/">project</a> (where we found that in virtual reality, the impact points on the racket changed with the ball’s different speed of motion). So the most direct and also the most cost-effective way is to implement it in a virtual environment (VE).<br>Implementing in a VE has two promising advatanges. For one, measuring players’ performance is easy because we can heve every movement information (e.g., the impact point in Figure 1). For another, designing the feedback is easy because we have control over the whole environment. The first point is advantageous to verify the performance change with the presentation of missed balls. Moreover, it can also help to build a new evaluation system, which can be more objective. Take Figure 1 for example. I will present Figure 1 here again for easy of reference.<br><img src="/images/missV.png" alt="Swing and a Miss" width="50%" height="50%" center=""><br>Figure 1 shows one player’s performance. We outlined where the ball hits the racket using red circles and outlined the racket area using black dashed lines. In the right-bottom part of Figure 1, the two missed balls are very different. We think that the missed ball nearer to the racket can be regarded as an inadvertent mistake. In other words, it may be okay to count that ball while assessing the player’s ability. However, the farther one is obviously beyond the player’s ability level, which means that ball should not be counted into the player’s ability. To summarize, VE implementations enable to tell apart inadvertent mistake from lack of ability, and we believe that helps to build a more objective evaluation system.<br>The second advantage contributes to experimenting with different feedback. In VE, we can insert a canvas and give user the visualization immediately (as what Figure 1 shows). Besides, it is also easy to trigger auditory feedback. For example, we can arouse a sound, which reads “You missed 30 centimeters to the right and 20 centimeters to the top”, every time you miss a ball. Concerning techtile feedback, currently I am experimenting how to unify haptic feedback on collision (i.e., the ball collides with the racket) and haptic feedback on misses (i.e., the ball does not collide with the racket). The very brilliant advantage of designining haptic feedback is that it shortens the transition to real-world application. In other words, we can directly apply it to real-world playing, eliminating the doubt that such out-of-nothing feedback would interfere with the normal playing. </p>
<p><strong>REAL-WORLD IMPLEMENTATION</strong><br>In addition to the difficulty of designing the out-of-nothing feedback, implementing this idea in the real world also confronts with the tracking problem - we must integrate devices to track the ball.<br>Wide-area tracking with motion capture seems possible, but the quality is easily influenced by the environment. Moreover, the cost is high.<br>As a common solution in the field of tracking, sensors contribute another solution. However, integrating sensors to the racket poses another challenge. Such sensors should not be troublesome to players’ performing techniques. In other words, we should whether design the whole racket with sensors inserted, or find sensors small enough to tag on the racket or the player’s body.<br>The current on-going approach is tagging the milliwave radar, which is as small as a chip, on the racket to recognize the ball’s motion. However, the implementation task is challenging and I am struggling how to filter the noise of the moving racket.</p>
